Known bugs and problems:

*  still some libTw pointer alignment problems and some security issues
*  twlsobj misses some fields on big-endiam machines
*  after `./configure [OPTIONS]' you should `make' in the top-level directory,
   as `make' in a subdirectory may fail to properly update dependencies
*  Compiling with gcc 2.95.2 (is this egcs actually ?)
   may give problems depending on the options you use to compile.
   Using "-g -O2" resulted in a non-working binary for me :(
