From 0.2.7 to 0.2.8: (Massimiliano Ghilardi, 02 May 2000)
	* Added options `stdout' and `TERM=<terminal>' to display `-hw=tty'
	  The first is to force twin to use stdout as display method on
	  Linux console even if vcsa is available.	  
	  The second option makes possible for twattach to specify
	  the terminal type.
	  Usage: `-hw=tty[@device],TERM=<term>' or `-hw=tty[@device],stdout'
	* Added option `font=<fontname>' to display `-hw=X'.
	* Added INCOMPLETE support for libGGI display, use with `-hw=ggi'
	* Added `-padx <X>' and `-pady <Y>' options to twsetroot.
	* Added option `-e cmd [args ...]' to twterm. Example: twterm -e pine
	* Cleaned up mixing Menu -> File -> Suspend and Menu -> File -> Detach
	* Cleaned up core dumping:
	  core now correctly spots where fatal signals were received.
	* Added consolemap translation support,
	  in a way that is independent from the underlying display
	  (the one in 0.2.7 worked only on Linux console with -hw=tty,stdout)
	  Created `twmapscrn', the twin-equivalent of `mapscrn'.
	  When started from Linux console, twin will already load the current
	  consolemap translation, so twmapscrn is often not necessary.
	  This will hopefully make a certain russian user happy *GRIN*.
	  
From 0.2.6 to 0.2.7: (Massimiliano Ghilardi, 17 Apr 2000)
	* Added configurable screen background, and the external program
	  `twsetroot' to customize it.
	* Top window and Focused window are no longer the same thing:
	  now you can focus a non-top window too.
	* Also changed the effect of the BACK button on the window
	  top-right corner: now it acts as Raise+Focus on non-top windows,
	  and as Lower+UnFocus on top window.
	* Left-clicking on a window no longer Raises it, only Focuses it:
	  try dragging or resizing a non-top window ;)
	* Left-clicking on the screen background UnFocuses all windows
	  and pops up the Default Menu.
	* Added Menu -> Window -> Raise/Lower
        * Added WM Smart Window Placement.
	  Coders note: Just don't specify where you want to Map the window,
	  and the WM will (try to) choose a good place.
	* Added X11 selection compatibility: you can now cut-n-paste
	  from X11 to twin and vice-versa.
	* Hopefully fixed non-english (russian, ...) translation table support
	  when running on Linux console (i.e. mapscrn(8); feedback welcome).
	  On other displays, it is just not supported yet :(
	* Fixed a memory leak in twsysmon.
	* Fixed a SEGFAULT when moving windows out-of-screen.
	
From 0.2.5 to 0.2.6: (Massimiliano Ghilardi, 04 Apr 2000)
	* Fixed random SEGFAULT on Menu -> Window -> Send HotKey
	* Fixed an insidious bug:
	  after twin was detached-and-reattached, the tty of the next
	  opened shell window was becoming the controlling tty of twin;
	  instead a reattached twin should run with no controlling tty at all.
	  This had the nasty side effect of killing twin
	  when closing the <next opened shell window> !
	* Added configure option to disable blink / high intensity background
	  on textmode terminals. This should fix headaches of people
	  too lazy to use SVGATextMode that keep looking at blinking
	  focused window ;)
	* Finished Window List. It pops up by middle-click on the desktop,
	  and it also gets automatically updated when you
	  open/close/reorder windows :)
	* Added Menu -> Window -> Scroll for keyboard-based window scrolling.
	* `twattach -v <args>' now reports any error message generated
	  during the attach attempt (`-v' stands for `verbose').
	  Unluckily, this change makes version 0.2.6 of twin and twattach
	  incompatible with older versions. Always use twin and twattach
	  of the same version and you will be fine.
	* Added Menu -> ð -> Option window to change runtime options:
	  shadows displacement, cursor visibility, tty blink/high background,
	  auto-hide menu, custom font (the latter requires running on
	  a Linux console and loading the VGA font file fonts/vgafont.raw)
	  
	  Side effect: When the Menu is auto-hidden, Menu -> Window -> <ZOOM>
	  gives a real fullscreen window.
	
From 0.2.4 to 0.2.5: (Massimiliano Ghilardi, 27 Mar 2000)
	* Made display size persistant (if HW allows twin to choose size).
	* Fixed `twattach -hw=tty' to correctly react to window size change,
	  and fixed `Twin, native' display method for the same problem.
	* Cleaned up copyright: libTw is now LGPLed.
	* Added KeyCode support on X11 and Linux console drivers:
	  keyboard event also report a meaningful TW_* code for direct
	  keyboard recognition. This allows keyboard shortcuts for
	  menu/window/screen actions like resizing a window
	  or transversing a menu. Infact next change is...
	* Rebuilt hotkey support for menu/window/screen actions.
	* Started adding Window List and Menu `Common Items'.
	* Modularized HW display drivers. If you compiled some HW support
	  as module, twin will NOT autoprobe for it and you will need to use
	  `twin -hw=<display>' to load and use a modularized HW driver.

From 0.2.3 to 0.2.4: (Massimiliano Ghilardi, 20 Mar 2000)
	* Fixed a SEGFAULT at startup when compiled without
	  "Use custom malloc/free routines (EXPERIMENTAL)".
	* Fixed build problems when compiling without X11 support.

From 0.2.2 to 0.2.3: (Massimiliano Ghilardi, 14 Mar 2000)
	* Fixed a bunch of SEGFAULTs when displaying a screen without windows.
	* Added a second screen, just to show twin handles it.
	* Added a default menu when no windows are on screen...
	  so I can omit showing the clock at startup without
	  making twin useless :)
	* Added libTw support: twin can now directly connect to another twin,
	  open a window there and display on it.
	* Twin can now runtime attach/detach to any supported display;
	  look README, section "8) Attach/Detach" for details.
	* Added twin_wrapper to have twin append its TWDISPLAY on command line.
	
From 0.2.1 to 0.2.2: (Massimiliano Ghilardi, 06 Mar 2000)
	* Fixed a SEGFAULT when switching to X11 display method
	  after a Suspend.
	* Added gzip (compressed) socket support.
	
From 0.2 to 0.2.1: (Massimiliano Ghilardi, 22 Feb 2000)
	* Optimized main loop by reordering MsgPort checks;
	  Result: removed two extra loops across the whole main loop
	  for each external event (keyboard,mouse,clients) received.
	* Tweaked socket protocol to decrease bandwidth usage.
