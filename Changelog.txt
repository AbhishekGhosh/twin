From 0.3.2 to 0.3.3: (Massimiliano Ghilardi, 12 Jul 2000)
	* Ported to AIX 3.2. I only had to fix minor problems
	  like #includes and a few functions not available on it.
	  Twin still does not compile out-of-the-box on AIX 3.2 and
	  you need to work a little manually, see README.porting.
	* Added twin <-> libTw protocol handshaking.
	  Tweaked internal libTw protocol to allow passing NULL
	  instead of arrays where it makes sense;
	  WARNING: don't mix twin or libTw from 0.3.3 and up
	  with older twin or libTw... it will not work.
	* Cleaned up and modularized the window manager.
	  Now you can write your own twin window manager!
	* Fixed SEGFAULT on video activity while running detached.
	* Fixed two socket-related bugs that could send libTw
	  initialization data to the wrong client, freezing both who gets
	  the unexpected data and who was waiting for it.
	  This happened more often if twdisplay was in use.
	* Optimized custom malloc/free with memory blocks > PAGE_SIZE.
	* Added mouse support and `This' button to Display Window.
	* X11 keyboard support cleanups.
	
From 0.3.1 to 0.3.2: (Massimiliano Ghilardi, 08 Jun 2000)
	* Fixed internal FdWQueued bookkeeping.
	* Fixed mouse redrawing problems with `-hw=tty'.
	* Fixed libTw to let twattach and twdisplay work
	  also on compressed connections.
	* Fixed a few SEGFAULTs on exit.
	* Fixed a buffer overrun in twterm
	  which sometimes made it completely non-working.
	* Fixed 1x1 display detection after Menu -> ð -> Detach
	* New option `,noinput' common to all display HW : starts the display
	  as view-only, ignoring all mouse/keyboard input coming from it.
        * Added `make menuconfig': it uses "dialog" as user interface.
	  Of course, let me know if your version of dialog gives problems
	  on `make menuconfig'.
	* Fixed palette support on Linux console.
	* Completely rewritten cut-and-paste code to make it non-blocking
	  on the server. Updated all clients, display drivers and twdisplay
	  for the new Selection API: now twdisplay supports Selection too.
	  Selection support on hw_tty and hw_ggi is still missing
	  since underlying HW does not have an usable Selection mechanism.
	  People, the code I had to write for cut-and-paste is a nightmare!
	
From 0.3.0 to 0.3.1: (Massimiliano Ghilardi, 16 May 2000)
	* Updated README for the changes in twattach and for
	  multiple display support.
	* Fixed autoloading consolemap translation from
	  kernel, which got broken in 0.3.0
	* Fixed 'disable blink/high background' option,
	  which got broken in 0.3.0
	* Fixed small redraw glitches on X11 display
	  when window gets unobscured.
	* Added option `drag' to X11 display driver.
	  The driver will try to use XCopyArea to speedup
	  redrawing only if you explicitly specify `-hw=X[@...],drag...'
	  Previously this was enabled by default, but I noticed
	  many X servers eat more CPU with XCopyArea than with a redraw.
	  Your mileage may vary.
	* Optimized expose events on X11 display not to cause
	  redraws also on other displays.
	* Optimized attach/detach in multi-display scenario
	  if no resize happens: draw only on the new display HW.
	* Finished smart display resizing. Try attaching/detaching/resizing
	  one of the displays when multiple ones are used...
        * Finished twdisplay (required adding some new libTw functions).
	  Actually a pair of small things are still missing in twdisplay:
	  cut-and-paste compatibility with the real display (X11, etc..)
	  and palette changing support, but it is equally *VERY* usable.
	  
	  	Please take a few minutes to carefully (re)read
	  	section 8. Attach/Detach of the README
	  	as twdisplay adds noticeable power
	  	to twin's attach/detach capabilities!
	  
	
From 0.2.8 to 0.3.0: (Massimiliano Ghilardi, 10 May 2000)
	* Added VNC-style multiple simultaneous displays support
	  and updated twattach to manage them. Now you can have
	  twin:0 display on X and on twin:1 which displays on twin:0 ...
	  Also fixed a few deadlocks related to such a setup.
	* (UNFINISHED) Added VNC-style client-implemented displays:
	  `twdisplay' starts a display driver then connects
	  to twin and registers it. This allows any kind of setups,
	  including attaching twin on a console of another machine,
	  or having twin:0 display both on X and on twin:0 itself (!),
	  and also protects twin from deadlocks and crashes
	  of libX11 and other libraries used for the various displays.
	* Due to the two changes above, NEVER assume twin quitted
	  just because you closed all its displays.
	  Even killing a server (X, another twin, ...) where twin
	  was displaying may not kill it;
	  To be sure twin actually exits, either use Menu -> File -> Quit
	  from the default menu or, if you really feel brutal,
	  send it a fatal signal (SIGTERM, SIGSEGV, ...).
	  Sending SIGKILL is not advised, as tty displays will be left
	  messed up and you will get a stale /tmp/.Twin:<x> socket.
	* Modified HW display drivers to allow multi-head.
	* Modified libTw to allow multi-head,
	  and bumped version number to libTw.so.2.
	  Clients will need to be recompiled to use the new library.
	* Added Menu -> ð -> Display to list / detach displays.
	* Added Menu -> ð -> Refresh.
	* Continued libggi display.
	  Still INCOMPLETE (keyboard doesn't work), but I feel more and more
	  unsatisfied by libggi and lost enthusiasm about it.
	* Fixed memory and file descriptor leaks in Tw_Close()
	* Added option `-hw=tty@-' to twattach:
	  tells twin to attach to its own controlling tty.
	  (`-hw=tty' instead uses the controlling tty of twattach)
	  
From 0.2.7 to 0.2.8: (Massimiliano Ghilardi, 02 May 2000)
	* Added options `stdout' and `TERM=<terminal>' to display `-hw=tty'
	  The first is to force twin to use stdout as display method on
	  Linux console even if vcsa is available.	  
	  The second option makes possible for twattach to specify
	  the terminal type.
	  Usage: `-hw=tty[@device],TERM=<term>' or `-hw=tty[@device],stdout'
	* Added option `font=<fontname>' to display `-hw=X'.
	* Added INCOMPLETE support for libggi display, use with `-hw=ggi'
	* Added `-padx <X>' and `-pady <Y>' options to twsetroot.
	* Added option `-e cmd [args ...]' to twterm. Example: twterm -e pine
	* Cleaned up mixing Menu -> File -> Suspend and Menu -> File -> Detach
	* Cleaned up core dumping:
	  core now correctly spots where fatal signals were received.
	* Added consolemap translation support,
	  in a way that is independent from the underlying display
	  (the one in 0.2.7 worked only on Linux console with -hw=tty,stdout)
	  Created `twmapscrn', the twin-equivalent of `mapscrn'.
	  When started from Linux console, twin will already load the current
	  consolemap translation, so twmapscrn is often not necessary.
	  This will hopefully make a certain russian user happy *GRIN*.
	  
From 0.2.6 to 0.2.7: (Massimiliano Ghilardi, 17 Apr 2000)
	* Added configurable screen background, and the external program
	  `twsetroot' to customize it.
	* Top window and Focused window are no longer the same thing:
	  now you can focus a non-top window too.
	* Also changed the effect of the BACK button on the window
	  top-right corner: now it acts as Raise+Focus on non-top windows,
	  and as Lower+UnFocus on top window.
	* Left-clicking on a window no longer Raises it, only Focuses it:
	  try dragging or resizing a non-top window ;)
	* Left-clicking on the screen background UnFocuses all windows
	  and pops up the Default Menu.
	* Added Menu -> Window -> Raise/Lower
        * Added WM Smart Window Placement.
	  Coders note: Just don't specify where you want to Map the window,
	  and the WM will (try to) choose a good place.
	* Added X11 selection compatibility: you can now cut-n-paste
	  from X11 to twin and vice-versa.
	* Hopefully fixed non-english (russian, ...) translation table support
	  when running on Linux console (i.e. mapscrn(8); feedback welcome).
	  On other displays, it is just not supported yet :(
	* Fixed a memory leak in twsysmon.
	* Fixed a SEGFAULT when moving windows out-of-screen.
	
From 0.2.5 to 0.2.6: (Massimiliano Ghilardi, 04 Apr 2000)
	* Fixed random SEGFAULT on Menu -> Window -> Send HotKey
	* Fixed an insidious bug:
	  after twin was detached-and-reattached, the tty of the next
	  opened shell window was becoming the controlling tty of twin;
	  instead a reattached twin should run with no controlling tty at all.
	  This had the nasty side effect of killing twin
	  when closing the <next opened shell window> !
	* Added configure option to disable blink / high intensity background
	  on textmode terminals. This should fix headaches of people
	  too lazy to use SVGATextMode that keep looking at blinking
	  focused window ;)
	* Finished Window List. It pops up by middle-click on the desktop,
	  and it also gets automatically updated when you
	  open/close/reorder windows :)
	* Added Menu -> Window -> Scroll for keyboard-based window scrolling.
	* `twattach -v <args>' now reports any error message generated
	  during the attach attempt (`-v' stands for `verbose').
	  Unluckily, this change makes version 0.2.6 of twin and twattach
	  incompatible with older versions. Always use twin and twattach
	  of the same version and you will be fine.
	* Added Menu -> ð -> Option window to change runtime options:
	  shadows displacement, cursor visibility, tty blink/high background,
	  auto-hide menu, custom font (the latter requires running on
	  a Linux console and loading the VGA font file fonts/vgafont.raw)
	  
	  Side effect: When the Menu is auto-hidden, Menu -> Window -> <ZOOM>
	  gives a real fullscreen window.
	
From 0.2.4 to 0.2.5: (Massimiliano Ghilardi, 27 Mar 2000)
	* Made display size persistant (if HW allows twin to choose size).
	* Fixed `twattach -hw=tty' to correctly react to window size change,
	  and fixed `Twin, native' display method for the same problem.
	* Cleaned up copyright: libTw is now LGPLed.
	* Added KeyCode support on X11 and Linux console drivers:
	  keyboard event also report a meaningful TW_* code for direct
	  keyboard recognition. This allows keyboard shortcuts for
	  menu/window/screen actions like resizing a window
	  or transversing a menu. Infact next change is...
	* Rebuilt hotkey support for menu/window/screen actions.
	* Started adding Window List and Menu `Common Items'.
	* Modularized HW display drivers. If you compiled some HW support
	  as module, twin will NOT autoprobe for it and you will need to use
	  `twin -hw=<display>' to load and use a modularized HW driver.

From 0.2.3 to 0.2.4: (Massimiliano Ghilardi, 20 Mar 2000)
	* Fixed a SEGFAULT at startup when compiled without
	  "Use custom malloc/free routines (EXPERIMENTAL)".
	* Fixed build problems when compiling without X11 support.

From 0.2.2 to 0.2.3: (Massimiliano Ghilardi, 14 Mar 2000)
	* Fixed a bunch of SEGFAULTs when displaying a screen without windows.
	* Added a second screen, just to show twin handles it.
	* Added a default menu when no windows are on screen...
	  so I can omit showing the clock at startup without
	  making twin useless :)
	* Added libTw support: twin can now directly connect to another twin,
	  open a window there and display on it.
	* Twin can now runtime attach/detach to any supported display;
	  look README, section "8) Attach/Detach" for details.
	* Added twin_wrapper to have twin append its TWDISPLAY on command line.
	
From 0.2.1 to 0.2.2: (Massimiliano Ghilardi, 06 Mar 2000)
	* Fixed a SEGFAULT when switching to X11 display method
	  after a Suspend.
	* Added gzip (compressed) socket support.
	
From 0.2 to 0.2.1: (Massimiliano Ghilardi, 22 Feb 2000)
	* Optimized main loop by reordering MsgPort checks;
	  Result: removed two extra loops across the whole main loop
	  for each external event (keyboard,mouse,clients) received.
	* Tweaked socket protocol to decrease bandwidth usage.
