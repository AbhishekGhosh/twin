Building and installing twin

For the impatient, it basically reduces to
./configure
make
make install

But of course you may want to know more details:
First, you might want to edit the files `makerules' and `makeautoconf.in'
to change the install directory, tweak compiler flags (enable debugging), etc.
Also, someone may want to tweak the configuration options generated
by `./configure'; this is possible with `make config' or `make menuconfig'
-- warning: if you enable options that were disabled by `./configure',
build will almost certainly fail! --
but `make config' or `make menuconfig' ask questions for many options
one may not know the meaning of.

For a discussion about MANUALLY configuring twin (almost never necessary),
see the file `Configure', distributed with twin in the docs/ subdirectory.
For instructions about installing twin, see the file `Tutorial',
section 4, again in the docs/ subdirectory.
