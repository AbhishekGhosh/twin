Twin - a Textmode WINdow environment, by Massimiliano Ghilardi
--------------------------------------------------------------

Version 0.3.9

Twin is a windowing environment with mouse support, window manager,
terminal emulator and networked clients, all inside a text display.

It supports a variety of displays:
* plain text terminals (any termcap/ncurses compatible terminal,
  Linux console, twin's own terminal emulator);
* X11, where it can be used as a multi-window xterm;
* itself (you can display a twin on another twin);
* twdisplay, a general network-transparent display client, used
  to attach/detach more displays on-the-fly.

Currently, twin is tested on Linux (i386, PowerPC, Alpha) and on FreeBSD.
I had yet no chance to seriously test it on other systems.

Getting twin


Since you are reading this README, you probably already have it,
anyway twin can be downloaded from

http://sourceforge.net/projects/twin/


--------------------------------------------------------------
Installing twin

For the impatient, it basically reduces to
make config
make
make install

But of course you may want to know more details:
First, you might want to edit the file `MakeRules' to change
the install directory, tweak compiler flags (enable debugging), etc.
Also, the `make config' or `make menuconfig' asks questions for
many options one may not know the meaning of.

For a discussion about configuring twin, see the file `Configure',
distributed with twin in the docs/ subdirectory.
For instructions about installing twin, see the file `Tutorial',
section 4, again in the docs/ subdirectory.
