Twin - a Textmode WINdow environment, by Massimiliano Ghilardi
--------------------------------------------------------------

Version 0.4.4

Twin is a windowing environment with mouse support, window manager,
terminal emulator and networked clients, all inside a text display.

It supports a variety of displays:
* plain text terminals (any termcap/ncurses compatible terminal,
  Linux console, twin's own terminal emulator);
* X11, where it can be used as a multi-window xterm;
* itself (you can display a twin on another twin);
* twdisplay, a general network-transparent display client, used
  to attach/detach more displays on-the-fly.

Currently, twin is tested on Linux (i386, PowerPC, Alpha, Sparc)
and on FreeBSD; SunOS porting is in progress.
I had yet no chance to seriously test it on other systems.

Building and installing twin

To build and install twin, GNU make and an ANSI C compiler are required.

For the impatient, it basically reduces to
./configure
make
make install

But of course you may want to know more details:
First, you might want to edit the files `makerules' and `makeautoconf.in'
to change the install directory, tweak compiler flags (enable debugging), etc.
Also, someone may want to tweak the configuration options generated
by `./configure'; this is possible by MANUALLY configuring twin
(almost never necessary), see the help file `Configure' for this --
it is distributed with twin in the docs/ subdirectory.
For instructions about installing twin, see the file `Tutorial',
section 4, again in the docs/ subdirectory.
