TODO:

contrib/ tree
look at tvision widgets and methods
security statement on sockets:
   The authorization method currently used is similar to Xauthority:
   the file .TwinAuth in your home directory holds some magic data that
   clients use to answer the challenge received from twin. If that data
   is wrong or the file doesn't exist, clients can connect to twin only
   using the unix socket (TWDISPLAY=:<something>) so they must run
   on the same machine as twin; remote programs won't be able to connect.
		  
   Also, the unix socket is set to permissions 600, so only the owner can connect
   to it (at least on Linux it works this way). The 'challenge' is actually an MD5
   check: server sends 256 bytes of random data; client does MD5 of that data +
   .TwinAuth and sends MD5 back. If server agrees on MD5, it grants connection.
